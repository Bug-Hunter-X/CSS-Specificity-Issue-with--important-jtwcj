To resolve the issue, it's recommended to avoid relying solely on `!important`. Instead, adjust the CSS selectors to increase the specificity of the rule intended to be applied.  Here's a modified CSS code that addresses this:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.special-paragraph {
  font-size: 14px;
}

div .special-paragraph {
  font-size: 14px; /* Increased Specificity */
}
```

By adding `div .special-paragraph`, we've increased the specificity of the rule that sets the font size to 14px and avoid relying on `!important`.  This approach is more robust, maintainable, and avoids potential conflicts that `!important` can cause.
